# WIND-WAVE Repository

## Overview
WIND-WAVE is a project focused on forecasting wind-wave parameters along the Indian coastline using multi-tasking machine learning techniques. The repository leverages reanalysis(mostly), satellite, and buoy datasets to provide long-term forecasts, aiding in coastal management and disaster mitigation.

### Current Focus: Significant Wave Height (SWH)
This repository is currently dedicated to forecasting **Significant Wave Height (SWH)** with the following objectives:
- Develop models using diverse datasets for accurate predictions.
- Provide extended forecasts ranging from 1 to 12 months.
- Support coastal flooding, storm surge monitoring, and risk management efforts.

## Features
- Multi-tasking Machine Learning models for efficient forecasting.
- Integration of data from reanalysis, satellite observations, and buoy measurements.
- Scalable and accurate long-term wave forecasting capabilities.

## Project Objectives
1. Develop robust ML models to predict significant wave height.
3. Enhance coastal risk management by providing actionable insights on coastal flooding and storm surges.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Arju-Jawla/WIND-WAVE.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Explore the datasets and models provided for SWH forecasting.
4. Run the models using the provided scripts for long-term forecasting.
